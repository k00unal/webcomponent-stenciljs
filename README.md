# ADD Jest Library

To add Jest all you need to do in stencil is to type

```
npm run test

```

```
installing dependencies: @types/jest, jest, jest-cli, @types/puppeteer, puppeteer

```

All dependency will be installed autmatically.

Also to run the E2E Test run :

```
1. npm run start

```

Then in another terminal Run

```
2. npm run test

```

I have intentionally failing one test so we can see actual comaparison how jest works.
